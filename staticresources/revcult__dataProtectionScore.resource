{"typeToTip":{"Encryption Analysis Jobs Per Month":"Consider scheduling at least one monthly analysis job on the Settings page to ensure that new fields available for encryption are detected and that new blockers are also identified.","Blocked by Configuration":"All the reasons a field could be blocked are displayed here, so the summary of blockers on this chart may be greater than the number of selected Fields. Viewing these blockers in the OwnBackup Secure Platform Encryption Analyzer enables you to deep link to where blockers can be resolved.","Seldom Used High Risk Fields":"If these high-risk fields are not in use, consider removing them from the org or locking down access to reduce risk surface.","Potential High Risk Candidates":"Fields identified as potentially high-risk are a great place to start when classifying fields within the Org. It is best practice to continue monitoring potentially high-risk fields by using the Potentially High Risk Candidates filter for the Fields list. This will help protect the Org as it grows in usage.","Data Classified":"On the Data Classification tab, finish classifying all high risk fields, at a minimum.  Also consider setting the Field Usage attribute to identify high risk fields that are in use and those that are not fully deprecated/never used.  Once finished, select the Security Insights tab and run an Analysis to see how well this high risk data is protected."},"totalPointsPossible":100.00,"totalPointsAchieved":0.00,"score":0.00,"keyToDismissed":{"Encryption Analysis Jobs Per Month":false,"Blocked by Configuration":false,"Seldom Used High Risk Fields":false,"Potential High Risk Candidates":false,"Data Classified":false},"keyToColor":{"Encryption Analysis Jobs Per Month":"#6201E8","Blocked by Configuration":"#c23934","Seldom Used High Risk Fields":"#ffa500","Potential High Risk Candidates":"#2faf44","Data Classified":"#1798c1"},"dataSeries":[{"name":"Data Classified","data":[0.00]},{"name":"Potential High Risk Candidates","data":[0.00]},{"name":"Seldom Used High Risk Fields","data":[0.00]},{"name":"Blocked by Configuration","data":[0.00]},{"name":"Encryption Analysis Jobs Per Month","data":[0.00]},{"name":"Data Classified","data":[65.00]},{"name":"Potential High Risk Candidates","data":[10.00]},{"name":"Seldom Used High Risk Fields","data":[10.00]},{"name":"Blocked by Configuration","data":[5.00]},{"name":"Encryption Analysis Jobs Per Month","data":[10.00]}],"colors":["#1798c1","#2faf44","#ffa500","#c23934","#6201E8"],"allDismissed":false}
